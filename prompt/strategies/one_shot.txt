Example:

Context:
Data integration is the process of combining data from different sources into a unified and consistent view. Organizations often store data in multiple systems such as databases, cloud applications, and files, which creates data silos. Data integration techniques bring this data together so it can be analyzed and used effectively.

A common approach to data integration is ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), where data is extracted from source systems, transformed into a standardized format, and loaded into a central repository such as a data warehouse. Modern platforms may also support real-time data integration and automated data pipelines.

Effective data integration improves data quality, enables comprehensive analytics, and supports business intelligence and decision-making across the organization.

Question:
What is data integration?

Answer:
