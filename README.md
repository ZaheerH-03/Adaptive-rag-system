# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System 🚧

> **Status:** Work in Progress (Actively Under Development)

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains an **end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** designed to combine the strengths of information retrieval with large language models (LLMs). The goal is to deliver **grounded, source-aware, and up-to-date responses** by augmenting generation with retrieved context from external knowledge bases.

The project is currently under **active development**. Core components are being implemented incrementally with a focus on modularity, scalability, and production readiness.

## 🧠 What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances traditional LLMs by:

* Retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge source
* Injecting retrieved context into the generation step
* Reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy

This approach is widely used in **enterprise chatbots, knowledge assistants, and domain-specific QA systems**.

## 📊 Current Status

🚧 **This project is under active development.**
Features, APIs, and internal structure may change as the system evolves.

Progress updates and major milestones will be reflected through commits and documentation updates.

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

* Initial end-to-end RAG pipeline
* Evaluation on domain-specific datasets
* Query routing (RAG vs direct LLM)
* Caching and performance optimization
* Deployment-ready configuration

## 📜 License

This repository is intended for **learning, experimentation, and research purposes**.
